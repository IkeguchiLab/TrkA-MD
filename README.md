 TrkAd5-TP1

 Supporting information for a paper describing REST/MD simulations for TrkAd5-TP1.

 The conventional MD and REST simulations were performed using GENESIS version 1.3.0.


 TrkAd5-TP1-cMD: This folder contains input files for cMD simulations of TrkAd5-TP1 complex. 

 TrkAd5-TP1-REST: This folder contains input files for REST simulations of TrkAd5-TP1 complex. 

 TrkAd5-TP1P6G-REST: This folder contains input files for REST simulations of TrkAd5-TP1P6G complex. 

 TP1-REST: This folder contains input files for REST simulations of the isolated TP1.

 TP1P6G-REST: This folder contains input files for REST simulations of the isolated TP1P6G.

 In these folders, input files of the energy minimization and equilibrations are in Equilibration folder,
 and the psf file is in PSF folder.

 For REST simulations, the toppar files of the CHARMM force field are required.
 The toppar files of the CHARMM force field can be downloaded from http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml.
